## ERC20 Tokens - PishTokens

### Overview 

This project provides a Solidity smart contract to create and manage ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers a range of features for token creation, management, and interaction, adhering to the ERC-20 standard.

### Project Features

- **Token Creation**: Deploy your own ERC-20 token with customizable parameters such as name, symbol, and decimal places.
- **Token Transfers**: Allow users to transfer tokens to other addresses efficiently, following the ERC-20 standard protocols.
- **Token Minting**: Enable the contract owner to mint new tokens, thereby increasing the total supply as needed.
- **Token Burning**: Allow users to burn their tokens, reducing the total supply and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens.

### Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `Pish.sol` code into the Remix IDE.
2. Compile the Solidity code to ensure there are no errors.
3. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network.
4. Interact with the deployed contract by executing transactions such as token transfers, minting, and burning through the Remix IDE interface.

### Deployment

Deploying the ERC-20 token contract on the Ethereum network involves several key steps:

1. **Choose a Network**: Decide whether to deploy on the Ethereum mainnet or a test network (e.g., Sepolia, Amoy, Base Sepolia) for initial testing.
2. **Deploy via Remix IDE**: After compiling the contract in Remix IDE, use the deployment tab to deploy the contract to the chosen network by making use of the Injected Provider - Metamask. Ensure you have enough Ether in your account to cover gas fees.
3. **Verify Contract**: Once deployed, verify the contract on Etherscan to make the source code publicly accessible and readable. This increases transparency and trust.
4. **Interact**: You can then interact with functions like the mint, transfer etc and verify them on Etherscan.
